# nutree.si
Submission for GarudaHacks 3.0

## Inspiration
To educate Indonesians regarding food nutrition and raise awareness for healthy eating habits, in a fun manner!
Nowadays it is common for people to take pictures of their meals before digging in to later share it with their friends on Instagram, so why not make a platform where people could share their meals and keep track of their nutritional intake (for those extra fitness points!) at once? 

## What it does
* Allows users to track their daily nutrition intake
* Discover macros of commonly found foods in Indonesia
* Save your own dishes and post the photo on Instagram

## How we built it
First we made a mockup of the application in Figma to better visualize the app and its features.
React Native was then used for development alongside the extensive NativeBase UI library. 
## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to design an intuitive app with a tech stack that is relatively new to us.
Difference in time zones for each team members also hinder us from collaborating more effectively.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working in a functional team and having a functional MVP.
## What we learned
App development is not as straightforward as we thought it'd be.
## What's next for nutree.si
Extend the functionality of the application by having a backend service to store user accounts, expand the database to include more food items, and having a social feature (inspiration: BeReal) so that you could keep up with what your friends are eating daily.
